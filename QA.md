What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

Step 1: 
Data Profiling: I will determine the data types, null values, and unique values in each table.
```sql
-- Get column data types and nullability for the products table 
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'products';
```
```sql
-- Count unique values for the fullvisitorid column in the all_sessions table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid)
FROM all_sessions;
```
Step 2: Data Validation: I will perform some queries to determine certain validations.
-- Check for missing data in the all_sessions table
SELECT *
FROM all_sessions
WHERE productsku IS NULL;
-- Check for duplicate data in the sales_report table
SELECT productsku, COUNT(*)
FROM sales_report
GROUP BY productsku
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;



QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
