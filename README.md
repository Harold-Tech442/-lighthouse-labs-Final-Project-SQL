# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to explore the activities of an online store, analysis it, and answer questions regarding its revenue and performance from various parts of the world.

## Process
The process involved extracting the data from csv file, cleaning it by removing duplicates, irrelevant columns, formatting the data types, etc., to make it useful. After that, various analytical exercises were done, using SQL, to provide valuable insights to the end users.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
I found out that the majority of the companyâ€™s sales where from North America and Europe. The company might want to come up with strategies to increase traffic, hence sales, in other parts of the world.

## Future Goals
I would have done more job on the data cleaning front.
