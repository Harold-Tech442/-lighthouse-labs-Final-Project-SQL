# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to explore the activities of an online store, analyse it, and answer questions regarding its revenue and performance from various parts of the world.

## Process
The process involved extracting the data from csv files, cleaning it by removing duplicates, irrelevant columns, formatting the data types, etc., to make it useful. After that, various analytical exercises were done, using SQL, to provide valuable insights to the end users.

## Results
I found out that the majority of the company’s sales where from North America and Europe. The company might want to come up with strategies to increase traffic, hence sales, in other parts of the world.

## Challenges 
The data was quite “dirty”, at least from my novice point of view. Lots of cleaning, converting of data types, missing values, etc. It was a tough, arduous, exciting, and huge learning process wrapped in one.

## Future Goals
Future goals, three words: practice, practice, practice.
